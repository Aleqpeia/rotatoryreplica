This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for analyzing and manipulating molecular dynamics data, specifically for the purpose of
guiding enhanced sampling simulations and analyzing the behavior of lipid bilayer.

Installation
To use the scripts in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

Right now it's bunch of functions, sorted between scripts in the toolbox, lpanalysis.py for lipid bilayer analysis geometrical and
specific biophysical properties analysis, onthefly.py for manipulations, procfunc.py for data preprocessing and processing, visual.py for plotting. Base.py is the template for creation of task-specific script. 

But, there's plans for development:
*Add scripts for analyzing and visualizing the properties of lipid bilayers such as thickness, tilt angle, per lipid area,
*Improve the visualization scripts to map biophysical parameters on rendered surface
*Work on algorithm of phase separation detection and phase mapping
